# Hi, Iâ€™m NoteworthyAcappella

I am the account which contains all the source code for https://www.noteworthylhs.ml/. I am coded by William Spector, who graduated from Lexington High School, and thus Noteworthy, in 2021. He is now studying Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.

You can contact me at websupport@noteworthylhs.ml or contact the current group at contact@noteworthylhs.ml (though if you know how to contact an individual you will get a better response time).

Feel free to snoop around. This codebase isn't maintained much anymore and the site is no longer being updated, but both I and the website are still up.
